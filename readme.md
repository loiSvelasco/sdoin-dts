## **1. Account**

This section shows the basic overview of an account and how it is used in the system.

### **Creating an account**

Fields needed to create an account is a valid e-mail address, full name, school or unit the account needs to belong in, and a password

- ***e-mail address*** is needed for the system to send you an e-mail when requesting for a password reset
- ***full name*** is required to provide additional data on *who* received or released the document, this eliminates ambiguity in the system and provides much more needed information regarding how the documents are processed.
- ***school or unit*** is a group of users where an account belongs in, multiple users can be in a school or unit, and anyone can receive, release, or create a document *within* the unit

### **Signing in**

This does not need any additional explanation. Although, keep in mind 

### **Requesting for a new password**

As of April 05, 2022 - the feature to change password has not been implemented yet. However, accounts with forgotten passwords can be recovered through the ***I forgot my password*** button upon signing in.

If you forgot your password, enter your e-mail address on the field and you will receive an auto generated e-mail on how to reset your password, please check if you typed your e-mail correctly and check your spam or trash folders on your e-mail service provider. You will receive an e-mail instantly, if not - try again within a few minutes.


## **2. Adding documents**

Adding documents can only be done when a user is logged in. It is found on the left sidebar menu on the user's dashboard.
- Fields needed to add a document are as follows:
    - Document title
    - Description
    - Document type
    - Release to
    - Purpose / Remarks

Office origin, and the date of document creation are automatically generated.

### **Tracking number**

Upon document creation, an alert message will show on whatever page you are on below the page title. You can then write the tracking number on the physical document, or you can click on it, which leads us to the next item, printing of the tracking number.

### **Printing of sdoin-dts tracking number**

Printing of the document tracking number opens up a new tab, and a print preview. The placement of the tracking number and the barcode are at the top right corner of the page.

> This is the ideal process on how to print the tracking number on a physical copy of the document.
